Reporting a bug
===============

We will go in some ways you can write a useful bug report and help the developers.

Run godot from command line
---------------------------
If you already know how to use a command line you can skip this part.

A command line or a terminal is a program that offers you a way to run other programs by writing their name and the thing you want to do, instead of using your mouse. This has many advantages because you can do things faster this way. The other way would have been searching for your program's location and double-clicking it with your mouse and waiting, then searching where is the thing you want to do. Godot offers you the way to pass arguments when running it through the terminal, so it will do things faster this way. Another good thing about terminals is that the program you run spits out there extra information you can read, like errors or just helpful stuff, which you don't get when running a program without a command line.

Sorry about that, but most open source projects are being developed by volunteers and they choose on what to spend their time. You sure made your part for reporting the error.
